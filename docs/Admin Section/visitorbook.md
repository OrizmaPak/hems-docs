# Visitor Book

The Visitor List submodule provides detailed records of all visitors to the institution. It captures specific information such as the visitor's name, the number of persons in their party, contact information, purpose of visit, and the date of the visit. This submodule is vital for maintaining security and accountability, as it allows the institution to monitor and control access to its premises effectively.
