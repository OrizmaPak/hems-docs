# Admin Setup

The Admin Setup submodule allows administrators to configure various settings that influence how other submodules operate. This includes setting up types (e.g., user types, document types), defining purposes (e.g., purpose of a visit, complaint reasons), complaint types, sources, and references. By providing a centralized setup interface, this submodule ensures that all configurations are consistent across the system, reducing errors and improving efficiency.


1. Add Admin Setup
In the admin setup, super admin can add different criteria which are sorted by their type. The types are source, purpose, complaint type, reference.

2. Select Actions
The data list can be deleted and edited by super admin.
